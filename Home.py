                fundamental for a correct implementation and interpretation of numerical models, it also includes modules aimed at exposing the basic theoretical concepts that govern the operation of the most common wind turbines.

                The course will last five weeks: four weeks with classes, with an intermediate week for the autonomous development of exercises. 
                The classes will happen in two weekly sessions (Tuesday and Thursday), starting at 17:30, with a duration of 2h. 
                The sessions will combine the presentation of theoretical concepts with their demonstration in physical models (when possible) and the development of practical modelling exercises. 
                The practical applications will be more concentrated in the second sessions of each week.  
                The resolution of the exercises willth be supported by Python routines that simplify the interaction with the OpenFAST software and allow a quicker analysis of the obtained results. 
                The course has 16 contact hours (+6h of estimated autonomous work). 
                The course can be attained online, but the presence at FEUP is highly recommended, since in person it will be possible to provide a much better support in the resolution of the practical exercises.
